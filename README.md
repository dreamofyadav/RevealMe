**RevealMe** is a minimalist frontend project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It showcases an interactive profile or portfolio card where:

- 🖼️ An image is displayed by default  
- 👆 On hover, profile details are revealed with a smooth upward transition  
- 📄 Clicking "Read More" opens a resume in a new browser tab  

This project is perfect for personal portfolios, resumes, or learning advanced hover and transition effects using just frontend technologies.
